## R drive time analysis tutorial

This tutorial was created for a presentation in May 2021. 

It is adapted from [code](https://github.com/khnews/2021-delta-appalachia-stroke-access) used in the analysis for [In Appalachia and the Mississippi Delta, Millions Face Long Drives to Stroke Care](https://khn.org/news/article/appalachia-mississippi-delta-stroke-treatment-advanced-care-rural-access/). The story was a collaboration between KHN and InvestigateTV and published in May, 2021.

This tutorial is a simplified analysis based on that larger project. It looks at how many Mississippi state residents live within 45-minutes of a stroke center and how many live further away.
